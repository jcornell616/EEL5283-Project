# EEL5283-Project

ReadMe will be used to set agendas and organize work.

## Pre-Proposal

Due Oct. 13th

Write a brief description of the research topic that you plan to pursue for your project/term paper, as well 
as the specific problems or questions you plan to address in your proposal. You will be provided with 
guidelines and resources on how to gain access to data to be used for your project.  

### Background

Find research papers concerning the following:

* EEG-based BCIs
* Applications dealing with and extending from cursor control
* Open problems in EEG-based BCIs
* Potential algortihms (spike detection, neural decoding, spatial filtering, deep learning, etc.)

### Significance

EEG-based BCIs are a non-intrusive method for decoding neural signals. They can be used to help patients with paralysis to perform tasks such as controlling a computer screen or moving a prosthetic arm by interfacing the BCI with such external technologies.

### Researh Methodology

Data acquisition and pre-processing:

* Data is provided by Dr. Oweiss's lab
* Data stored in spreadsheet, each trial must be hand selected to enable for processing
* MATLAB script used to process each enabled trial and organize/display neural data
